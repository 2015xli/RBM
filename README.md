## Simple tutotial code for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)

The python code implements RBM with an example of MNIST digits image reconstruction.

It also includes a simple implementation of classifier with single-layer RBM, and a verynaive implementation of data sampling that generates digit images from numbers.
